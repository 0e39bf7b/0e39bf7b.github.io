  <p>A few days ago I&rsquo;d decided to configure Raspberry PI as a weather station to check temperature,
humidity, and pressure. So I need to access it on the network with SSH and a web browser. The
easiest way of solving this problem is using a static IP address. In this case, I have to set static
IP for Raspberry PI and then use this address in a browser. For me, it&rsquo;s more convenient to use a
human-readable hostname than remembering an IP address. I can modify <code>/etc/hosts</code> to associate
Raspberry PI IP with custom hostname but I have to perform this action on all of my devices. It&rsquo;s a
bit monotonous work if you have several computers and for some mobile devices, it&rsquo;s impossible to
configure.</p>
<p>In the case of complicated enterprise networks, it&rsquo;s common to configure a name server to perform
hostname resolution, but for a small home network with several computers, it can be a bit overkill
to configure and support a dedicated DNS server. Searching through the Internet I&rsquo;d found
<a href="https://www.khoi.io/post/raspberry-pi-ipad-pro-usb-c/">an article</a> about connecting Raspberry PI to
an iPad with a USB cable. The author accessed a device with the address <code>raspberrypi.local</code> without
any additional DNS configuration. So it should be a more lightweight alternative than a dedicated
DNS server for home networks.</p>
<p>A computer connected to a network has an address of the DNS server as a part of its network
configuration. When a piece of software (e.g. web browser) tries to access a remote host using
hostname it asks the DNS server to resolve a hostname into an IP address and then access a remote
host using the received IP address.</p>
<p>But what if there is no DNS server? Is it possible to perform hostname resolution? There is a set of
technologies called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking">zeroconf</a>. It
allows to creates a usable computer network without any additional manual configuration. One part of
zeroconf is a Multicast DNS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS">mDNS</a>) â€” a technology
that allows resolving some hostnames without a dedicated DNS server. When a mDNS client needs to
resolve a hostname, it sends a multicast message to <code>224.0.0.251</code> (or <code>ff02::fb</code> for IPv6) that asks
the host having that name to identify itself. The target machine multicasts a response with its
address, so all computers in the network can use this information to update their mDNS caches.</p>
<p>Multicast DNS is supported by various operating systems like Linux, MacOS X, or Windows 10.</p>
<p>Usually, there is a file on Linux devices named <code>/etc/nnswitch.conf</code> that allows different
applications to determine the sources from which to obtain name-service information and in what
order. On my Ubuntu 20.04 desktop the configuration looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mymachines
</code></pre><p>It describes such a chain of actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>check <code>/etc/hosts</code> for a requested address;</li>
<li>if <code>.local</code> domain was requested make a mDNS IPv4 request with avahi-daemon;</li>
<li>if mDNS lookup succeeded, but the requested entry was not found stop any further attempts;</li>
<li>make a DNS request;</li>
<li>try to resolve a hostname of container registered with
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/machined/">systemd-machined</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two services on Ubuntu that provide mDNS support: <a href="https://www.avahi.org/">Avahi</a> and
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-resolved">systemd-resolved</a>. By default, Ubuntu 20.04
uses Avahi for mDNS requests and systemd-resolved for DNS requests.</p>
<p>One more useful service connected with mDNS is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking#DNS-based_service_discovery">DNS Service Discovery</a>.
It&rsquo;s a way of using standard DNS programming interfaces, servers, and packet formats to browse the
network for services like printers, file-sharing, or chats.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pity but I haven&rsquo;t found how to configure Android Chrome to support mDNS. Moreover by default
my Android phone ignores DNS server from the router and uses <code>8.8.8.8</code> that is why even
configuration with a dedicated DNS server will not work out of the box. So I need to access my
Raspberry PI with IP address from my Android devices.</p>
<p>After all, a just set a hostname <code>weather</code> for the Raspberry PI, configured nginx to listen to port
80 and it made it possible to check the weather with <code>http://weather.local</code> from my computers and
iOS devices.</p>
