      <description>Java 21 introduces virtual threads. Asynchronous programming models are no longer necessary in many cases, as we can assume that our code runs on virtual threads. This allows to simplify the code of web applications significantly.</description>

      <description>The Linux kernel has traditionally been compiled using GCC and binutils. However, it is now possible to build the Linux kernel with Clang. Distributions such as Android, ChromeOS, OpenMandriva, and Chimera Linux already use Clang-built kernels. ClangBuildLinux is an effort to get the Linux kernel to compile with Clang.</description>

      <description>I use Solarized Dark color scheme for a long time. Also, I use htop utility to inspect system processes on my Linux machines. Unfortunately, some numbers (like 1 min load average, and totals in the cpu/mem bar graphs) are barely visible with Solarized Dark. Today I&amp;rsquo;ve found that htop has &amp;ldquo;Broken Gray&amp;rdquo; theme that fixes this glitch. Just press F2, select &amp;ldquo;Colors&amp;rdquo; and set an appropriate theme.</description>

      <description>Why are slow computers from 80s were solving the same problems as modern computers nowadays? Why 1000x times faster hardware can freeze with text editors? Some everyday tasks become more complicated. E.g. text rendering in 80s was just a coping of fixed-size bitmaps to video memory. Nowadays, this process becomes a lot more sophisticated. It consists of several stages that depend on each other and the processor can spend a lot of time on this widespread task.</description>

      <description>I used to work with GitLab CI/CD, but today I&amp;rsquo;ve tried GitHub Actions. It is similar solutions but there is one important difference: GitLab CI/CD performs all workspace manipulations (like git clone) in a separate preconfigured container, so you can use any Docker image for your jobs. In GitHub Actions everything works in one container, so you can&amp;rsquo;t use any Docker image that you want to use. You have to install all essential tools that perform actions/checkout@v4 and similar things (Node.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you need to configure HTTPS for a web resource that works in a network without Internet access. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to use Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt to issue a certificate. One solution is using your own certificate authority and sign certificates yourself.
Generate CA (Certificate Authority) key and certificate with a command:
openssl req -x509 -nodes \ -newkey RSA:2048 \ -keyout root-ca.key \ -days 3650 \ -out root-ca.crt \ -subj &amp;#39;/C=GB/ST=London/L=London/O=Home/CN=Home&amp;#39; Copy root-ca.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d found an article &amp;ldquo;Now available: Fedora on Lenovo laptops!&amp;rdquo;. It is said that Lenovo sells ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 8, ThinkPad P53, and ThinkPad P1 Gen 2 laptops with Fedora pre-installed. From the one side, it&amp;rsquo;s great for the Linux community, because pre-installed Linux means that all laptop systems are tested and work properly. From the other side, Fedora provides updated packages for approximately 13 months, so it&amp;rsquo;s not the best choice for a pre-installed system.</description>

      <description>All smartphones are similar to each other nowadays. It&amp;rsquo;s just a screen with several buttons on the edge. Most of the time it&amp;rsquo;s OK, but some tasks require typing a lot of text, so an on-screen keyboard is not the best solution. Several years ago, it was possible to buy a slider keyboard case for popular smartphones, so most of the time you use your smartphone as usual, but when you want to type a long email or execute several command over SSH you just slide a physical keyboard and use your device like a PDA.</description>

      <description>After the installation of language packages in Kubuntu 22.04, I&amp;rsquo;d found that LANGUAGE variable had been changed. There was nothing in /etc/default/locale or ~/.pam_environment, so it looked a bit strange. I&amp;rsquo;d realized that KDE writes locale configs into ~/.config/plasma-localerc, so I changed settings there and reload session. Now I have the desired value of the LANGUAGE variable.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I come across an idea that today&amp;rsquo;s computers are too complicated, and it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to understand them. People think that it was a lot easier in the 80s during the 8-Bit computer era to grasp all of what is going on inside of any single machine, because the computers were relatively simple and constrained.
I think it&amp;rsquo;s a controversial question. In the 80s, the computers were easier, but it was more difficult to find the information about them.</description>

      <description>GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY is a PostgreSQL construction that creates an identity column for a table and forbids to specify a value for this field manually. E.g.
CREATE TABLE users ( id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY, name VARCHAR NOT NULL ); INSERT INTO users(name) VALUES (&amp;#39;John Smith&amp;#39;); -- generates id value INSERT INTO users(id, name) VALUES (42, &amp;#39;Sam Smith&amp;#39;); -- throws an error </description>

      <description>When I need to access my home network from remote locations, I use WireGuard. It&amp;rsquo;s fast and simple to configure. In some countries, WireGuard is blocked by authorities. OpenVPN and L2TP/IPSec are often blocked as well. The option that works almost always is Cisco AnyConnect. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to run AnyConnect compatible server with ocserv. It is slower than WireGuard, but it can solve the problem when everything else is blocked.</description>

      <description>In September 2020 I&amp;rsquo;d written an article Ubuntu Snap: the Price of the Isolation. One inconvenience with Snap was the updates mechanism: it was impossible to disable auto-updates and check for new versions of software by hands. The epic with updates in Snap finally has ended:
August 15, 2022: the PR that allows to hold refreshes indefinitely for all the system&amp;rsquo;s snaps; November 15, 2022: it&amp;rsquo;s possible to disable auto-updates in Snap from the edge channel (here is the post in snapcraft blog); January 10, 2023: snapd 2.</description>

      <description>Continue talking about self-hosted services. There is a subreddit r/selfhosted where people discuss alternatives to popular online services that can be self-hosted without giving up privacy or locking you into a service you don&amp;rsquo;t control.

      <description>Some people use GitHub&amp;rsquo;s Gist as a blogging platform. It seems like an interesting idea: you can publish posts using built in Markdown, follow the other GitHub members and comment on their posts. Gist has a lot of useful features for technical writing, like source code syntax highlighting, or advanced formatting.
On the other hand, Gist is another vendor lock, like Twitter or Facebook. Actually, you do not own your account and it can be terminated any time without violation of the GitHub user agreement.</description>

      <description>I use Evolution mail client because it&amp;rsquo;s the only client that works well with Exchange. I used to install Evolution using flatpak, and it requires a password each time I start it. Today I&amp;rsquo;ve switched from flatpak version to apt version and now Evolution starts gnome-keyring-daemon and uses it to store passwords. So I type my keyring password only once. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot more convenient.</description>

      <description>I use NRF24L01 chips from time to time. It&amp;rsquo;s a low-cost radio with small power consumption. That is why these chips are really useful for communications between IoT devices. NRF24L01 exposes an interface for low-level communications between two chips. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s enough, but the other tasks require higher-level network protocols like TCP. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve found an inspiring post that explains how to set up a TCP/IP stack over NRF24L01. The author had developed nrfnet — an application that creates virtual interface on Raspberry PI and uses NRF24L01 as a backend for data transmission.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to update my desktop at Kubuntu 22.04. To be sure that there will be no problems with devices and the software that I use every day, it&amp;rsquo;s important to a check new distro before installing it on the internal hard drive. I&amp;rsquo;d decided to install Kubuntu on an external disk.
First, I&amp;rsquo;d used one of my USB flash drives. Unfortunately, all of them were extremely slow, that is why I gave up on this idea.</description>

      <description>Suppose you configure network settings on a remote Linux machine. The only way to access this machine is an SSH connection. To prevent access problems in case of network configuration failure, try such option:
open tmux; write sleep 600 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; reboot (you should cancel this command every 5-9 minutes and start again); perform network configuration in a separate tab. It&amp;rsquo;s important to make only temporary changes that will be lost after a reboot:</description>

      <description>ired.team — a site dedicated to pentesting, security tools and techniques. Recently I&amp;rsquo;d read an article about Windows API Hooking from this resource. It describes a technique that can be used to intercept API calls. Malware software often uses such technique to different malware software to inject malicious code into the user&amp;rsquo;s process.</description>

      <description>hping is a really flexible network diagnostic tool. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files between a covered channel, and many other features. It helps to investigate network failures and fix its, so I think, it&amp;rsquo;s a must-have instrument for every developer and admin.</description>

      <description>Do you know that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to download the whole Wikipedia or Stack Overflow with kiwix? Just go to library.kiwix.org, select required resource and download the dump. It can take several hours, even on a fast connection. Then use the reader to explore the resource offline. I prefer to install the reader from Flatpak: flatpak install flathub org.kiwix.desktop.
Kiwix is barely useful for fast Internet connection, but for some corner cases it can be extremely important.</description>

      <description>After updating to Kubuntu 22.04 my OpenVPN stop working with an error like:
OpenSSL: error:0A00018E:SSL routines::ca md too weak Cannot load inline certificate file Exiting due to fatal error The correct way to solve this issue is certificate regeneration, but I do not control the server. So the temporary solution is to add the line tls-cipher &amp;quot;DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=0&amp;quot; into ovpn config file. It allows OpenVPN to use weak tls cipher, so the connection starts as usual.</description>

      <description>Found an interesting article about curl&amp;rsquo;s options for connecting to the different host. Most of the time I&amp;rsquo;d changed Host HTTP header, and it was enough for my cases, but today I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that this solution is not acceptable when for HTTPS resources. Here, I need to specify the host name during SSL connection negotiation, so I can&amp;rsquo;t use HTTP headers. There is an SNI field that allows to tell the server which host I want to access.</description>

      <description>I write articles and docs using Vim. It&amp;rsquo;s convenient when the editor can check spelling on the fly, so I can fix mistakes as soon as possible. Sometimes I use different languages in one file and I want the editor to find spelling issues for all languages in it. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to set multiple languages for spell check in Vim with a command like :set spelllang=en_us,de_de, so the editor will use several dictionaries.</description>

I use it to prepare Vim for blog post editing like this: vim -c &#39;call ConfigDoc()&#39; post.md. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to add this function call into .vimrc for all .md files, because there are a lot of different markdown files that do not require this configuration. So command line argument does the trick.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I need to test new software or prepare isolated stands. I use VirtualBox for these tasks. I want to access VMs from the host PC and the easiest way to achieve this is by using bridged network adapters. Unfortunately, VM with a bridged network is exposed not only to the host but also to all machines in the network. VM relies on the router DHCP. It&amp;rsquo;s can be unacceptable for some locations.</description>

      <description>Vim 9.0 had been released several days ago. I started using Vim when the latest version was 6.4. The modes idea and navigation with j, k, k and l keys were unfamiliar to me and I&amp;rsquo;d spent a lot of time to get used to it. Now it&amp;rsquo;s something natural, so sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to use mainstream editors without Vim features. The most annoying thing with Vim 6.4 was the lack of editor tabs.</description>

      <description>One task that I perform these days is the configuration of the FreeIPA domain. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not trivial, so I need to debug some sort of quirky errors from time to time. Today I&amp;rsquo;d found Thomas C. Foulds&amp;rsquo;s blog that contains a lot of useful information about FreeIPA debugging. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely worth reading.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s possible to connect to a remote host over SSH using a public key. It&amp;rsquo;s a well-known feature which I use every day. SSH protocol is also used for the git clone command. I was curious about how Gitea implements the support of the SSH protocol. The first idea was about the custom SSH server. I&amp;rsquo;d inspected my local Gitea installation and found that there was no custom SSH server running, just the default sshd.</description>

      <description>Ubuntu 22.04 distributes Firefox as a snap package. It starts slower than Firefox installed as a deb-package and it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to control updates of the browser. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to install Firefox as a deb package from Mozilla Team PPA. There is a useful guide from omgubuntu.co.uk about how to configure the system to use this PPA.</description>

      <description>Kubuntu 22.04 has libssl 3.0.2, that is not compatible with libssl from old releases, so Viber messenger is not working. It shows an error message &amp;ldquo;No Connection&amp;rdquo; even the other network apps like Firefox work well. I think this bug will be fixed in future Viber versions. For now, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to perform a hotfix:
Install libssl 1.2.1 from Ubuntu 21.10:
wget http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1l-1ubuntu1.2_amd64.deb sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1l-1ubuntu1.2_amd64.deb Preload libssl 1.2.1 into Viber.</description>

      <description>What’s The Deal With Snap Packages? Snap package system offers a controversial approach for managing software. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely not a silver bullet. Two years ago I wrote an article with such a point of view and today I&amp;rsquo;ve found an article that shares my point of view in some way. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely worth reading. I think the user should control the system and package manager should allow to do it.</description>

      <description>Looked at Gitea as a self-hosted alternative for GitHub. It looks nice: a lot of useful features like global code search and template repositories. There is a comprehensive comparison of Gitea to other Git hosting solutions. It can help decide if Gitea is suited for your needs or not.
The only thing that surprised me a bit: the information about package registry is already in the official docs, but PR with this feature was merged only several days ago, so it will be available only in v1.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d used CentOS as a production environment for working projects. Some time ago Red Hat announced its plans to replace stable CentOS 8 with rolling release CentOS Stream. So, CentOS had been replaced with Oracle Linux. Today I&amp;rsquo;ve found that Oracle has its own Linux kernel build that is called Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel. They add some features like Ksplice that look interesting for high-load enterprise platforms.</description>

      <description>Falling down the rabbit hole of HiDPI screens and fractional scaling on Linux desktops I came across an interesting discussion on Reddit. It contains a lot of useful links that help to form an opinion on the subject.
I found that in the KDE X11 session fractional scaling is implemented on Qt Framework level, so each app scales its output itself. Gnome uses a different technique. It implies rendering everything at an integer factor and then downscaling using a raster operation.</description>

      <description>The majority of GUI apps on Linux are written using some toolkit like GTK or Qt. Such libs provide high-level abstractions like buttons or labels but the real rendering is executed on the backend like X11 or Wayland. I&amp;rsquo;d never thought about it. Today I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the X11 backend uses Xlib. To understand what level of abstraction GUI libraries provide, you can take a look at this small tutorial. After writing a Hello World with Xlib it becomes clear for me why developers introduce more abstraction layers.</description>

      <description>Some time ago I&amp;rsquo;d bought Focusrite Scarlett gen3 audio interface because it&amp;rsquo;s one of the devices that work on Linux out of the box. Unfortunately, some features of the device can be accessed only through Focusrite Control that is not available on Linux. Recently I&amp;rsquo;d found an interesting stream about improving Focusrite Scarlett Driver that shows how to access additional features of the device on the Linux platform. It is worth watching if you are interested in reverse engineering and Linux drivers.</description>

      <description>I have a dual boot setup on my PC: Ubuntu and Windows 10. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s required to reload Windows for processing system updates. By default, Grub loads the first system from the list, which is Ubuntu. It&amp;rsquo;s inconvenient. I think it&amp;rsquo;s better to make Grub remember the last loaded OS and start it after reboot.
To achieve this behaviour you need to perform such steps:
Add to /etc/default/grub following strings:</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;d found that ping utility on Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 21.04 works without root permissions, suid flag, or CAP_NET_RAW capability. In the Kernel documentation it is said that ping uses ICMP_PROTO datagram sockets and it&amp;rsquo;s possible to allow users without root permissions to create such sockets:
ping_group_range - 2 INTEGERS
Restrict ICMP_PROTO datagram sockets to users in the group range. The default is &amp;ldquo;1 0&amp;rdquo;, meaning, that nobody (not even root) may create ping sockets.</description>

      <description>I use Thunderbird as an e-mail client. I&amp;rsquo;d configured several rules on the server side for splitting messages from INBOX into several folders (Jira, GitLab, etc.). It&amp;rsquo;s important to execute these rules on the server side because I have several clients and, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make the same rules for each client. By default, Thunderbird checks only the INBOX folder of the IMAP account, so I had no notifications about new mail in the other folders.</description>

      <description>There is a Full HD screen on my 14&amp;quot; laptop. It looks like some sort of HiDPI for me, and that is why controls of an interface on native resolution are too small, so it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to use. On Windows, an interface was scaled for 125% and looks a lot better.
I tried to make the same settings on Ubuntu 21.04, and there were some issues. There are two options: a new Wayland session and a more traditional Xorg session.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve used to ask questions about different open source projects on Freenode IRC several years ago. Today I&amp;rsquo;ve found that Freenode staff members had left the company and started Libera.Chat. You can find the roots of this decision on Wiki page.</description>

      <description>Recently Docker has updated subscriptions, and now Docker Desktop remains free only for individuals or small businesses. I think it&amp;rsquo;s OK that Docker as a company wants to get money from their products. At the same time, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit strange to change the rules of the game for existing products. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how the community reacts to this announcement.</description>

      <description>One of the most important parts of laptop security is disk encryption. It can help to save your personal data if you lost your computer or it was stolen. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to encrypt everything. You need some code to ask for the password from the user and decrypt the system.
There are several options when you work with Ubuntu:
encrypt only home directory; encrypt the operating system partition during the installation process and rely on UEFI Secure Boot for Linux kernel verification; encrypt not only the operating system partition, but also the boot partition; look at Full Disk Encryption Howto for more details.</description>

      <description>I have been using macOS on the laptop for a few years, but recently I switched back to Ubuntu. It has several advantages for my usage pattern: the environment which my programs use in production, Docker with fast FS and without imposed updates, and a lot more control over the system.
One thing that I miss is Time Machine. Having up-to-date backups is extremely important. It helps when your computer stops working normally, or it has been stolen, or you just want to move from one laptop to another.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I find interesting links or have some thoughts about software engineering problems that I want to save and share. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough for an article in the blog, so I don&amp;rsquo;t publish it there. That is why I&amp;rsquo;d created this page, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to post some short messages here.</description>
