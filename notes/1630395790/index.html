  <p>One of the most important parts of laptop security is disk encryption. It can help to save your
personal data if you lost your computer or it was stolen. It&rsquo;s impossible to encrypt everything. You
need some code to ask for the password from the user and decrypt the system.</p>
<p>There are several options when you work with Ubuntu:</p>
<ul>
<li>encrypt only home directory;</li>
<li>encrypt the operating system partition during the installation process and rely on UEFI Secure
Boot for Linux kernel verification;</li>
<li>encrypt not only the operating system partition, but also the boot partition; look at
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019">Full Disk Encryption Howto</a>
for more details.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that disk encryption is not free. There is always a performance hit if
you use full disk encryption, but it can be unnoticeable on modern hardware. There are some tests
from Phoronix about disk encryption:</p>
