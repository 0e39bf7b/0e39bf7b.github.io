with Wayland fractional scaling. It looks blurry at 125%. Fortunately, it has its own scaling
feature. So, the best option is to disable fractional scaling for the desktop environment and allow
Idea to do all the stuff. There is an experimental setting <code>xwayland-native-scaling</code> in Gnome that
disables scaling for apps that can scale themselves, but it was introduced only in Gnome 47. The
same thing in KDE works since 5.27. So, KDE still the best choice if you need fractional scaling.</p>
