  <p>It&rsquo;s time to update my desktop at Kubuntu 22.04. To be sure that there will be no problems with
devices and the software that I use every day, it&rsquo;s important to a check new distro before
installing it on the internal hard drive. I&rsquo;d decided to <a href="https://0e39bf7b.blog/posts/install-ubuntu-on-external-disk/">install Kubuntu on an external
disk</a>.</p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;d used one of my USB flash drives. Unfortunately, all of them were extremely slow, that is
why I gave up on this idea. Also, I have one relatively old HDD that I used for backups several
years ago. Usually, HDD is much faster and reliable than USB flash drives, so it looked like a
suitable solution for my task. I&rsquo;d bought 2.5&quot; HDD enclosure and connected the HDD to my desktop. I
tried to install Kubuntu on it, but with no luck: it had shown an I/O error on the FS creation step.
An error reproduced on different distros, so it was not a distro-specific.</p>
<p>I thought the HDD was too old and had a lot of bad blocks, so I tried to run <code>badblocks -svn -b 512 -c 65536 /dev/sda</code> to check the device. Unfortunately, it took an hour to check 0.1%, so I&rsquo;d
canceled the operation. I was ready to give up on the whole idea, but suddenly I tried a different
USB cable, and it worked! Kubuntu had installed with no errors.</p>
<p>The moral: all parts of the chain can be faulty, so check all of them one by one, and it can help
you solve the problem.</p>
