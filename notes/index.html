  <p>Intellij Idea
<a href="https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403794663570-Blurry-text-when-using-Sway-or-fractional-scaling-on-Wayland">does not work well</a>
with Wayland fractional scaling. It looks blurry at 125%. Fortunately, it has its own scaling
feature. So, the best option is to disable fractional scaling for the desktop environment and allow
Idea to do all the stuff. There is an experimental setting <code>xwayland-native-scaling</code> in Gnome that
disables scaling for apps that can scale themselves, but it was introduced only in Gnome 47. The
same thing in KDE works since 5.27. So, KDE still the best choice if you need fractional scaling.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;d faced with fractional scaling issues on Linux desktop in 2022 for the first time. I&rsquo;d tried
Ubuntu and other distributions with Gnome and KDE, X11 and Wayland. There were different graphical
artifacts. After several attempts, I&rsquo;d found that the only suitable option for my 14&quot; 1080p laptop
was KDE 5 X11.</p>
<p>Today I&rsquo;ve tried <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> 42 Workstation and Fedora 42 KDE Plasma
Desktop. Both use Wayland by default and it works perfectly for 125% scaling on my laptop: smooth
animations, nice Nvidia driver support, no tearing, no artifacts.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re still in doubt about using Wayland or not, then it&rsquo;s time to try.</p>

  <p>Recently I have bought GoPro 12. It&rsquo;s a really nice action camera, but I was interesting if it is
possible to use it as a webcam. I have found that GoPro 12 exposes a network interface when
connected over USB, so I can use <code>curl</code> to switch the device to the webcam mode and listen the UDP
video stream. <code>ffmpeg</code> can output into <code>v4l2loopback</code>, so all messengers and browsers can use this
virtual device as a webcam.</p>
<p>Video latency is about 500-700ms on my i7-10700K, so it&rsquo;s possible to use the device for video
calls.</p>
<p>There is a GitHub repo
<a href="https://github.com/jschmid1/gopro_as_webcam_on_linux">gopro_as_webcam_on_linux</a> which contains a
shell script that makes all required actions easier.</p>

  <p>Why are slow computers from 80s were solving the same problems as modern computers nowadays? Why
1000x times faster hardware can freeze with text editors? Some everyday tasks become more
complicated.  E.g. text rendering in 80s was just a coping of fixed-size bitmaps to video memory.
Nowadays, this process becomes a lot more sophisticated. It consists of several stages that depend
on each other and the processor can spend a lot of time on this widespread task.</p>

  <p>I used to work with <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/">GitLab CI/CD</a>, but today I&rsquo;ve tried
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. It is similar solutions but there is one
important difference: GitLab CI/CD performs all workspace manipulations (like <code>git clone</code>) in
a separate preconfigured container, so you can use any Docker image for your jobs. In GitHub Actions
everything works in one container, so you can&rsquo;t use any Docker image that you want to use. You have
to install all essential tools that perform <code>actions/checkout@v4</code> and similar things
(Node.JS stack). On the one side it&rsquo;s less convenient, but on the other it allows to control all
workspace manipulation more precisely.</p>

  <p>Sometimes you need to configure HTTPS for a web resource that works in a network without Internet
access. It&rsquo;s impossible to use Let&rsquo;s Encrypt to issue a certificate. One solution is using your own
certificate authority and sign certificates yourself.</p>
<p>Generate CA (Certificate Authority) key and certificate with a command:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>openssl req -x509 -nodes \
  -newkey RSA:2048       \
  -keyout root-ca.key    \
  -days 3650             \
  -out root-ca.crt       \
  -subj &#39;/C=GB/ST=London/L=London/O=Home/CN=Home&#39;
</code></pre><p>Copy <code>root-ca.crt</code> to <code>/usr/local/share/ca-certificates</code> and execute <code>update-ca-certificates</code>. After
this action, utilities like <code>curl</code> will trust certificates signed with a custom CA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s required to add a new CA into your browser. In Firefox open Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security,
find &ldquo;View Certificates&hellip;&rdquo; button and add <code>root-ca.crt</code>.</p>
<p>Generate certificate with a command:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>openssl x509 -req      \
  -CA root-ca.crt      \
  -CAkey root-ca.key   \
  -in example.com.csr  \
  -out example.com.crt \
  -days 3650           \
  -CAcreateserial      \
  -extfile &lt;(printf &#34;subjectAltName = DNS:example.com\nauthorityKeyIdentifier = keyid,issuer\nbasicConstraints = CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth&#34;)
</code></pre><p>As a result there are two files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>example.com.crt</code> â€” SSL certificate for domain <code>example.com</code> signed by custom CA;</li>
<li><code>example.com.key</code> â€” the key for SSL certificate.</li>
</ul>

  <p>All smartphones are similar to each other nowadays. It&rsquo;s just a screen with several buttons on the
edge. Most of the time it&rsquo;s OK, but some tasks require typing a lot of text, so an on-screen
keyboard is not the best solution. Several years ago, it was possible to buy a slider keyboard case
for popular smartphones, so most of the time you use your smartphone as usual, but when you want to
type a long email or execute several command over SSH you just slide a physical keyboard and use
your device like a PDA. It&rsquo;s a bit strange that there is no such an option nowadays. Of course, it&rsquo;s

  <p>After the installation of language packages in Kubuntu 22.04, I&rsquo;d found that <code>LANGUAGE</code> variable had
been changed. There was nothing in <code>/etc/default/locale</code> or <code>~/.pam_environment</code>, so it looked a bit
strange. I&rsquo;d realized that KDE writes locale configs into <code>~/.config/plasma-localerc</code>, so I changed
settings there and reload session. Now I have the desired value of the <code>LANGUAGE</code> variable.</p>

  <p>Sometimes I come across an idea that today&rsquo;s computers are too complicated, and it&rsquo;s difficult to
understand them. People think that it was a lot easier in the 80s during the 8-Bit computer era to
grasp all of what is going on inside of any single machine, because the computers were relatively
simple and constrained.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a controversial question. In the 80s, the computers were easier, but it was more
difficult to find the information about them. There was no modern Internet with Google,
StackOverflow and Open Source, so the computer enthusiasts spent a lot of time to understand
relatively basic things. Today, there are a lot of possibilities to understand how computers work.
There are books like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Organization-Design-RISC-V-Architecture/dp/0128122757">Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition</a>
or university courses like
<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2020/schedule.html">MIT Operating Systems Engineering OCW course</a>.
Also, it&rsquo;s possible to start your research with RISC-V microcontrollers that are a lot easier than
X86 CPU.</p>
<p>I know a lot of developers who do not have enough time or desire to explore internal mechanisms of
the frameworks and libraries they use every day and very few people even try to read the
documentation and the source code to go deeper. The same was during 80s: people just learn some
basic commands to start the game from ZX Spectrum cassette, but they did not understand how these
commands actually worked. If someone really wants to understand the computer&rsquo;s internal mechanisms,
it&rsquo;s possible to do. The only required thing is a desire to learn.</p>

  <p>When I need to access my home network from remote locations, I use WireGuard. It&rsquo;s fast and simple

  <p>Some people use GitHub&rsquo;s Gist as a blogging platform. It seems like an interesting idea: you can
publish posts using built in Markdown, follow the other GitHub members and comment on their posts.
Gist has a lot of useful features for technical writing, like source code syntax highlighting, or
advanced formatting.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Gist is another vendor lock, like Twitter or Facebook. Actually, you do not own
your account and it can be terminated any time without violation of the GitHub user agreement. I
also use GitHub for this blog, but I use it as a static pages hosting platform, so if I will find
something better or GitHub will disable my account, I can switch to something else without losing my
blog.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s some sort of paranoia, but it&rsquo;s better to do something before it will be too late.</p>

  <p>I use <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/products/nrf24-series">NRF24L01</a> chips from time to time. It&rsquo;s a
low-cost radio with small power consumption. That is why these chips are really useful for
communications between IoT devices. NRF24L01 exposes an interface for low-level communications
between two chips. Sometimes it&rsquo;s enough, but the other tasks require higher-level network protocols
like TCP. Recently I&rsquo;ve found <a href="http://www.theresistornetwork.com/2020/11/nerfnet-wireless-networking-over.html">an inspiring
post</a> that explains
how to set up a TCP/IP stack over NRF24L01. The author had developed
<a href="https://github.com/aarossig/nrfnet">nrfnet</a> â€” an application that creates virtual interface on
Raspberry PI and uses NRF24L01 as a backend for data transmission. The speed of such connection is
not too high, but it allows to use software like SSH or web server.</p>
<p>The nrfnet project looks like a proof of concept that connects two Raspberry PI nodes. I&rsquo;ve found a
more mature project about NRF24L01 Networking â€” <a href="https://github.com/TMRh20">TMRh20</a>. It comprises a
plenty of libraries that allow to create a network of Internet enabled RF24/Arduino sensors by
providing an API similar to the Arduino Ethernet library. If you are interested in this subject, you
should definitely take a look at <a href="https://tmrh20.blogspot.com/">TMRh20s Project Blog</a>.</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s time to update my desktop at Kubuntu 22.04. To be sure that there will be no problems with
devices and the software that I use every day, it&rsquo;s important to a check new distro before
installing it on the internal hard drive. I&rsquo;d decided to <a href="https://0e39bf7b.blog/posts/install-ubuntu-on-external-disk/">install Kubuntu on an external
disk</a>.</p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;d used one of my USB flash drives. Unfortunately, all of them were extremely slow, that is
why I gave up on this idea. Also, I have one relatively old HDD that I used for backups several
years ago. Usually, HDD is much faster and reliable than USB flash drives, so it looked like a
suitable solution for my task. I&rsquo;d bought 2.5&quot; HDD enclosure and connected the HDD to my desktop. I
tried to install Kubuntu on it, but with no luck: it had shown an I/O error on the FS creation step.
An error reproduced on different distros, so it was not a distro-specific.</p>
<p>I thought the HDD was too old and had a lot of bad blocks, so I tried to run <code>badblocks -svn -b 512 -c 65536 /dev/sda</code> to check the device. Unfortunately, it took an hour to check 0.1%, so I&rsquo;d
canceled the operation. I was ready to give up on the whole idea, but suddenly I tried a different
USB cable, and it worked! Kubuntu had installed with no errors.</p>
<p>The moral: all parts of the chain can be faulty, so check all of them one by one, and it can help
you solve the problem.</p>

  <p>Suppose you configure network settings on a remote Linux machine. The only way to access this
machine is an SSH connection. To prevent access problems in case of network configuration failure,
try such option:</p>
<ul>
<li>open <code>tmux</code>;</li>
<li>write <code>sleep 600 &amp;&amp; reboot</code> (you should cancel this command every 5-9 minutes and start again);</li>
<li>perform network configuration in a separate tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to make only temporary changes that will be lost after a reboot:</p>
<ul>
<li>do not execute commands like <code>systemctl enable nftables</code>, use <code>systemctl start nftables</code> instead;</li>
<li>do not use <code>--permanent</code> option for <code>firewall-cmd</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case of network configuration failure, your machine will be rebooted in 10 minutes. All

  <p>Found <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/04/05/curl-another-host/">an interesting article</a> about
curl&rsquo;s options for connecting to the different host. Most of the time I&rsquo;d changed <code>Host</code> HTTP
header, and it was enough for my cases, but today I&rsquo;ve realized that this solution is not acceptable
when for HTTPS resources. Here, I need to specify the host name during SSL connection negotiation,
so I can&rsquo;t use HTTP headers. There is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication">SNI
field</a> that allows to tell the server which
host I want to access. Curl uses URL to prepare SNI field value: for command <code>curl https://example.com/foo</code> SNI value is <code>example.com</code> and when I set <code>Host</code> header, it does not affect
SNI at all. To change SNI the <a href="https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--resolve">&ndash;resolve</a> option can be
used:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>curl --resolve example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://example.com/
</code></pre><p>The command above populates curlâ€™s DNS cache with a custom entry for the host name <code>example.com</code> and
port <code>443</code> with the address <code>127.0.0.1</code>. That is why curl will use specified IP address to start TCP
connection and then use <code>example.com</code> for SNI field.</p>

  <p>Vim 9.0 <a href="https://www.vim.org/vim90.php">had been released</a> several days ago. I started using Vim
when the latest version was 6.4. The modes idea and navigation with j, k, k and l keys were
unfamiliar to me and I&rsquo;d spent a lot of time to get used to it. Now it&rsquo;s something natural, so
sometimes it&rsquo;s difficult to use mainstream editors without Vim features. The most annoying thing
with Vim 6.4 was the lack of editor tabs. I knew that there were

  <p>It&rsquo;s possible to connect to a remote host over SSH using a public key. It&rsquo;s a well-known feature
which I use every day. SSH protocol is also used for the <code>git clone</code> command. I was curious about
how Gitea implements the support of the SSH protocol. The first idea was about the custom SSH
server.  I&rsquo;d inspected my local Gitea installation and found that there was no custom SSH server
running, just the default <code>sshd</code>. Surprisingly, when I performed the command <code>ssh git@gitea</code> I got
the message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi there, &lt;username&gt;! You&rsquo;ve successfully authenticated with the key named &lt;key name&gt;, but Gitea
does not provide shell access. If this is unexpected, please log in with password and setup Gitea
under another user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d looked at the source code of the Gitea and found
<a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/1d04e8641d4abab6ce978bc2dc5523c2ddb2f628/cmd/serv.go#L140">serv.go</a>.
This module allows to perform <code>git clone</code> over SSH, but who calls it? I looked at the
<code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file in the Gitea home directory and get such a line:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>command=&#34;/usr/local/bin/gitea --config=/etc/gitea/app.ini serv key-1&#34;,... ssh-rsa ...
</code></pre><p><code>man authorized_keys</code> explains that <code>command</code> option specifies the command is executed instead of
the default shell. So when I write <code>git clone</code> git starts SSH connection and OpenSSH server checks
my key and if it&rsquo;s OK starts Gitea <code>serv</code> module.</p>
<p>This OpenSSH feature allows to restrict certain public keys to perform just a specific operation.
E.g. I can create a key and specify the command that calculates some server statistics. So if this
key is compromised, the intruder can get only server statistics but can&rsquo;t execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p>There are a lot more options for the <code>authorized_keys</code> file. I think the man page is worth reading.
I got a lot of new info about the utility I use for a long time.</p>

  <p>Falling down the rabbit hole of HiDPI screens and fractional scaling on Linux desktops I came across
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/lficfe/wayland_fractional_scaling_may_be_sort_of_a/">an interesting discussion on Reddit</a>.
It contains a lot of useful links that help to form an opinion on the subject.</p>
<p>I found that in the KDE X11 session fractional scaling is implemented on Qt Framework level, so each
app scales its output itself. Gnome uses a different technique. It implies rendering everything at
an integer factor and then downscaling using a raster operation. It&rsquo;s a more universal approach and
does not depend on the GUI framework, but it can lead to some sort of degradation for the font
rendering. It can be almost invisible for Apple-like retina displays with a 1.75 scale factor but
it&rsquo;s notable on the average 13&quot; - 14&quot; laptop 1080p screen.</p>
<p>I think the best way to avoid HiDPI rendering issues is using such displays that allow setting
integer scale factors like x2 on a 14&quot; screen with 2880Ñ…1800 resolution. All other techniques will
be always the compromise between GUI framework requirements, multi-screen setup support,
performance, and final picture quality.</p>

  <p>The majority of GUI apps on Linux are written using some toolkit like <a href="https://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a> or
<a href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt</a>. Such libs provide high-level abstractions like buttons or labels but the
real rendering is executed on the backend like <a href="https://x.org/wiki/">X11</a> or
<a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a>. I&rsquo;d never thought about it. Today I&rsquo;ve found that the
X11 backend uses <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/libX11/libX11.html">Xlib</a>. To
understand what level of abstraction GUI libraries provide, you can take a look at

Today I&rsquo;d tried to watch a video on my Kubuntu laptop with VLC. It prints errors like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Your input can&#39;t be opened:
VLC is unable to open the MRL &#39;smb://10.0.0.1/Share/video.mkv&#39;. Check the log for details.

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/er2udt/opening_video_files_from_dolphin_with_vlc_in/">described on Reddit</a>
â€” nothing changed. So I think, there is some bug in the VLC, that is why I used a different
solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <code>/usr/share/applications/vlc.desktop</code>.</li>
<li>Remove line <code>X-KDE-Protocols=ftp,http,https,mms,rtmp,rtsp,sftp,smb</code>.</li>
<li>Make sure that <code>kio-fuse</code> installed.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>X-KDE-Protocols</code> instructs Dolphin to pass smb URLs directly to VLC. Without this line, <code>kio</code> mounts
smb share and allows VLC to work with a local file.</p>

  <p>There is a Full HD screen on my 14&quot; laptop. It looks like some sort of HiDPI for me, and that is why
controls of an interface on native resolution are too small, so it&rsquo;s difficult to use. On Windows,
an interface was scaled for 125% and looks a lot better.</p>
<p>I tried to make the same settings on Ubuntu 21.04, and there were some issues. There are two
options: a new Wayland session and a more traditional Xorg session.</p>
<p>When I set up a 125% scale for the interface in the Wayland session, it looks great, but some apps
like Google Chrome, VS Code, or Slack look blurry out of the box. For some apps, it&rsquo;s possible to
fix it in some way using experimental features, that can lead to instability and random crashes.
Also, there is
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1718727">an extremely annoying bug in Firefox</a>: some
popups like Multi-Account Containers are cropped and it&rsquo;s impossible to use them. It will be fixed
only in Firefox 93 which will be released in October. There are a lot of small issues on Wayland
like <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/5157">Vim clipboard</a>, that is why I&rsquo;m not sure that Wayland
is ready for desktop now.</p>
<p>When I set up a 125% scale for the interface in the Xorg session all apps work properly, but there
are some artifacts in the interface like black rectangles around windows or black lines in random
places of the screen. It&rsquo;s better than Wayland but still not good enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d tried different Linux distributions and different desktop environments to find the best solution
for cases like mine. Xfce and Cinnamon work fine only with x2 and x3 scales. Elementary works with
x2 scale and allows to increase fonts, so texts look fine, but controls are too small. The
co-founder of Elementary
<a href="https://blog.elementary.io/what-is-hidpi/">says it&rsquo;s OK and I just need to buy another laptop</a>.</p>
<p>The solution I found is Kubuntu 21.04 with KDE 5.21.4. It allows setting 125% scale out of the box.
Everything works: Qt apps, GTK apps, Firefox, Google Chrome, and so on. That is why now I&rsquo;m a happy
KDE user.</p>

<li>encrypt the operating system partition during the installation process and rely on UEFI Secure

  <p>I have been using macOS on the laptop for a few years, but recently I switched back to Ubuntu. It
has several advantages for my usage pattern: the environment which my programs use in production,
Docker with fast FS and without <a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/183">imposed updates</a>, and
a lot more control over the system.</p>
<p>One thing that I miss is Time Machine. Having up-to-date backups is extremely important. It helps
when your computer stops working normally, or it has been stolen, or you just want to move from one
laptop to another.</p>
<p>Of cause, there are a lot of different backup solutions on Linux. I&rsquo;d found articles like
<a href="https://www.fosslinux.com/44619/best-linux-backup-tools.htm">The 10 Best Linux Backup Tools</a>,
<a href="https://www.ubuntupit.com/best-backup-software-for-linux/">The 15 Best Backup Software For Linux Desktop</a>,
or even
<a href="https://www.tecmint.com/linux-system-backup-tools/">25 Outstanding Backup Utilities for Linux Systems in 2020</a>.
All Linux backup utilities can be divided into two groups.</p>
<p>The utilities from the first group allow you to make incremental backups, data encryption and you
don&rsquo;t have to stop working during the backup creation, but you have to select a directory to backup.
Usually, it&rsquo;s a home directory because there are some pitfalls that stop me from selecting <code>/</code>. That
is why when you need to restore from the backup you have to install fresh Linux distribution
yourself with all your programs and only then restore your data like documents or photos from the
backup.</p>
<p>The second group includes the utilities that make the backup of the entire hard drive and you can
restore the entire system from such a backup. Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t use the computer during the
backup creation process and I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s possible to make incremental backups in this
case. When you need to restore from such a backup you can restore only all or nothing. It can be
inconvenient.</p>
<p>I want to find a tool that can backup my data from the home directory but also saves the system
configuration somehow. When I need to restore from the backup the tool should help me to install the
system with all settings and then restore the user data. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve not found such a tool
yet, so I have to use Gnome&rsquo;s default backup solution â€”
