  <p>All smartphones are similar to each other nowadays. It&rsquo;s just a screen with several buttons on the
edge. Most of the time it&rsquo;s OK, but some tasks require typing a lot of text, so an on-screen
keyboard is not the best solution. Several years ago, it was possible to buy a slider keyboard case
for popular smartphones, so most of the time you use your smartphone as usual, but when you want to
