  <p>Some people use GitHub&rsquo;s Gist as a blogging platform. It seems like an interesting idea: you can
publish posts using built in Markdown, follow the other GitHub members and comment on their posts.
Gist has a lot of useful features for technical writing, like source code syntax highlighting, or
advanced formatting.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Gist is another vendor lock, like Twitter or Facebook. Actually, you do not own
your account and it can be terminated any time without violation of the GitHub user agreement. I
also use GitHub for this blog, but I use it as a static pages hosting platform, so if I will find
something better or GitHub will disable my account, I can switch to something else without losing my
blog.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s some sort of paranoia, but it&rsquo;s better to do something before it will be too late.</p>
